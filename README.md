[i've spent hours on canva tryna get the bottom part to be more down bc originally it covered most of the screen]
There's a play now button for the actual game where you hear the song and guess what it is

Play Now page:

Over here you can choose which year you want to play in (only choose one year) & you can choose how many players are playing on same laptop screen
it's different because on single player mode it just asks you, but with more people each players answers are masked so nobody else can see what your tying

Here's single player mode:

There should be a green volume up button on the bottom, you NEED to CLICK it in order to here the music. Why? Because youtube automatically mutes autoplayed songs, so thats why you need to click that button to unmute the video

Thats what single player mode looks like when you are trying to answer

it also checks whether you got it right or wrong and gives you points accordingly (i find out song names by using the youtube api)

Multiplayer on same device:

you can see that the scoreboard on the bottom now has the three players

See!! Whenever you type its now masked so none of the other players can see it until everyone submits, and if you don't remeber what you typed you can always unmask it by clicking the eye

When everyone answers it looks like that, if its green it means its right and red means wrong
